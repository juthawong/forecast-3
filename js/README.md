# Forecast App

I created Forecast App as you described in requirements document. I spend about 6 hours to create all code, but most job was done after 3 hours, and then I tested all code to be correct with specification.

It's not perfect code, and could optimized or extended, but app had to be simple. It's example created fast as a challenge and I wanted to attract user with simplicity with nice design. I could use some framework, visualise weather with icons, and write tests, but to keep app simple I decided to do not do that.

I didn't have to use JSONP to fetch weather data, because of access-control-allow-origin:* header was sent. I didn't display the forecast in a chart, but still is attractive in my personal opinion, and can be useful.

I know about 2 bugs, but it's good example for further discussion still. I checked that API returns temperature values for 6 days at certain day times. There could be observed issue with date for user local time and API data returned at the same time, but it's matter of double checking, which date is used on API. I suppose it's UTC.

Finally, I believe it's enough good example of my skills and experience to invite me for meeting.
